Reflection on Design Thinking Project (VIDEO & REPORT):

This project reinforced my passion for leveraging AI to solve real-world problems. Moving forward, I aim to explore ways to scale and implement the adaptive traffic management system, while also addressing ethical considerations like fairness and transparency. The experience has deepened my belief in the power of design thinking as a framework for innovation.

In conclusion, the design thinking project on AI traffic management was a fulfilling learning experience that equipped me with practical skills and a mindset for tackling complex challenges. It has inspired me to continue exploring AI applications for societal benefit and to embrace a human-centered approach in all future endeavors.
